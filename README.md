# community-roadmap

If you are beginning your journey with
[Senzing](https://senzing.com/),
please start with
[Senzing Quick Start guides](https://docs.senzing.com/quickstart/).

You are in the
[Senzing Garage](https://github.com/senzing-garage)
where projects are "tinkered" on.
Although this GitHub repository may help you understand an approach to using Senzing,
it's not considered to be "production ready" and is not considered to be part of the Senzing product.
Heck, it may not even be appropriate for your application of Senzing!

The [Senzing Community Roadmap](https://github.com/senzing-garage/community-roadmap/projects/1)
gives a peek into the future of the Senzing Community.
It is the public roadmap for requesting and following the growth of the Senzing Community offerings.
